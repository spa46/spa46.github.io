# Mode

- **Bluetooth BR/EDR (Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate)**: In short, it supports small coverage and dedicates continuous connections.  

- **Bluetooth LE (Low Energy)**: Supports longer coverage than Bluetooth BR/EDR and it is idel for sending data for short amount of time such as **IoT (Internet of Things) Environment**. Moreover,     

- **Dual-Mode**: Supports both of two modes.

Various version of Bluetooth Stack with available protocols

![Various Version of Bluetooth Stack](/images/bluetooth/various_bt_stack.jpg)


## BlueZ

It is an official Linux Bluetooth stack. It provides support for core Bluetooth layers and protocols. This consists of followings:

- HCI Core
- HCI UART, USB and Virtual HCI device drivers
- L2CAP module
- Configuration and testing utilities

Required pakcages:

- Bluez-Firmware
- Bluez
- Bluez-dev

![Bluetooth Driver](/images/bluetooth/bt_driver.jpg)

- **bluetooth.ko**: contains core infrastructure of BlueZ. It exports sockets of the Bluetooth family Â– AF_BLUETOOTH. All BlueZ modules utilise its services.

- **hci_uart.ko & hci_usb.ko**: Correspond to BlueZ Bluetooth HCI implementation (Those HCI packets are transported over UART or USB).

- **l2cap.ko**: Relates to L2CAP layer of Bluetooth, which is responsible for segmentation, reassembly and protocol multiplexing.

- **bnep.ko**: By this, TCP/IP applications can run over Bluetooth. This emulates an Ethernet port over the L2CAP layer. The kernel thread named kbnepd is responsible for BNEP connections.

- **rfcomm.ko**: Responsible for running serial port applications like the terminal. This emulates serial ports over the L2CAP layer. The kernel thread named krfcommd is responsible for RFCOMM connections.

- **hidp.ko**: implements the HID (human interface device) layer. The user mode daemon hidd allows BlueZ to handle input devices like Bluetooth mice.

- **sco.ko**: implements the synchronous connection oriented (SCO) layer to handle audio. SCO connections do not specify a channel to connect to a remote host; only the host address is specified.

## Bluetooth Host

Part of the stack and from the stack, the **features** of the following are:

**L2CAP(Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol)**:

- The capability to multiplex data between different higher layer protocols; hence, various protocols like RFCOM, SDP, etc, can operate over it
- Segmentation and reassembly
- Quality of service
- It supports a group abstraction, enabling implementation for mapping a group on to a piconet

<br>

**RFCOMM (Radio Frequency Communication)**

- A serial port emulation protocol situated over the L2CAP layer. It emulates RS-232 control and data signals over the Bluetooth baseband.

- Roughly the same service and reliability guarantees as TCP. Unlike to TCP, which provides 65,535 ports, RFCOMM allows only 30.

**SDP (Service Discovery Protocol)**

- Required by all Bluetooth applications, Devices are discovered by this, and each service is identified by a universally unique identifier (UUID).

## Bluetooth Profile

- **GAP (generic access profile)**: requirements for detecting and establishing a connection to a Bluetooth device. It is a core profile that is available by default.
- **GOEP (generic object exchange profile)**: This defines the requirement of OBEX, a communication protocol used to exchange binary objects between devices while using minimal resources and usage models.
- **HSP (headset profile)**: This defines the procedure that supports the interoperability between **a headset and a mobile device** that the headset controls through AT commands, and depends upon the serial port profile.
- **SPP (serial port profile)**: This defines the requirements for virtual serial port connections over the RFCOMM
